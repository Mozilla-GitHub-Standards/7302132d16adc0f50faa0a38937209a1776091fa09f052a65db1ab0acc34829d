This analysis uses Spark to look at the entire dataset, as apposed to the other analysis which looked at random samples in the dataset. The primary purpose of this analysis is to compare an analysis of the entire dataset with the previous analysis of small samples. This is being done to check if the small sample was representative of the entire dataset.  \n\nThe previous Analysis can be found here: [eval_analysis.ipynb](eval_analysis.ipynb) and [eval_analysis.md](eval_analysis.md). An explanation for what eval is and a justification for why we are looking at eval usage can be found in the previous analysis.\n\nSimilairly to in the other analysis, we will refer to using eval, rather than both eval and new Function, for simplicity.\n\nAfter looking at the entire dataset we found:\n1. 3.72% of function calls are created using eval.\n2. 8.76% of web pages have atleast 1 function call created using eval.  This is very similair to the samples taken in the previous analysis which was 8.92%.\n3. 32.65% of scripts hosting functions created using eval are hosted on a different domain that the domain of the web page that uses them. This is rounghly half of what was found in the earlier sample based analysis."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from __future__ import division\nfrom pyspark.sql.functions import udf\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport tldextract"],"metadata":{"collapsed":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":2},{"cell_type":"code","source":["BUCKET = 'safe-ucosp-2017/safe_dataset/v1'\n\nACCESS_KEY = \"YOUR_KEY\"\nSECRET_KEY = \"YOUR_KEY\"\nENCODED_SECRET_KEY = SECRET_KEY.replace(\"/\", \"%2F\")\nAWS_BUCKET_NAME = BUCKET\n\nS3_LOCATION = \"s3a://{}:{}@{}\".format(ACCESS_KEY, ENCODED_SECRET_KEY, AWS_BUCKET_NAME)\nMOUNT = \"/mnt/{}\".format(BUCKET.replace(\"/\", \"-\"))\n\nmountPoints = lambda: np.array([m.mountPoint for m in dbutils.fs.mounts()])\nalready_mounted = np.any(mountPoints() == MOUNT)\nif not already_mounted:\n    dbutils.fs.mount(S3_LOCATION, MOUNT)\ndisplay(dbutils.fs.ls(MOUNT))"],"metadata":{"collapsed":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":3},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df = spark.read.parquet(\"{}/{}\".format(MOUNT, 'clean.parquet'))"],"metadata":{"collapsed":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":4},{"cell_type":"code","source":["unique_webpages = df.groupBy('location').count()\nunique_webpage_count = unique_webpages.count()"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":5},{"cell_type":"code","source":["function_count = df.count()"],"metadata":{"collapsed":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":6},{"cell_type":"code","source":["eval_calls = df[df.script_loc_eval.startswith('line')]\neval_call_count = eval_calls.count()"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":7},{"cell_type":"code","source":["webpage_using_eval = eval_calls.groupBy('location').count()\nwebpage_using_eval_count = webpage_using_eval.count()"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":8},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def check_if_different_domain(location, script_url):\n  location_domain = tldextract.extract(location).domain\n  script_domain = tldextract.extract(script_url).domain\n  \n  return location_domain != script_domain\n\nis_different_domain = udf(check_if_different_domain)\n\ndifferent_domain_df = eval_calls.withColumn(\n  'is_different_domain', is_different_domain(eval_calls.location, eval_calls.script_url)\n)\n\ndifferent_domains = different_domain_df[different_domain_df.is_different_domain == True].groupBy('script_url').count()\ndifferent_domain_count = different_domains.count()"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":9},{"cell_type":"code","source":["unique_script_urls = eval_calls.groupBy('script_url').count()\nunique_script_urls_count = unique_script_urls.count()"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":10},{"cell_type":"code","source":["eval_call_percentage = round(eval_call_count / function_count * 100, 2)\nprint(str(eval_call_percentage) + \"% (\" + str(eval_call_count) + \"/\" + str(function_count) + \") of total function calls are created using eval.\")"],"metadata":{"collapsed":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":11},{"cell_type":"code","source":["webpage_using_eval_percentage = round(webpage_using_eval_count / unique_webpage_count * 100 , 2)\nprint(str(webpage_using_eval_percentage) + \"% (\" + str(webpage_using_eval_count) + \"/\" + str(unique_webpage_count) + \") of web pages have atleast 1 function created using eval.\")"],"metadata":{"collapsed":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":12},{"cell_type":"code","source":["different_domain_percentage = round(different_domain_count / unique_script_urls_count * 100, 2)\nprint(str(different_domain_percentage) + \"% (\" + str(different_domain_count) + \"/\" + str(unique_script_urls_count) + \") of scripts are hosted on a different domain than the web page that called them.\")"],"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"execution_count":13}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"version":"3.5.2","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"name":"Safe Browsing - Read Demo","notebookId":4456733039430862,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python [default]","language":"python","name":"python3"},"anaconda-cloud":{}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
